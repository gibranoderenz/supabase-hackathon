## Cook Together

Cook Together is an app that can enable people in long-distance relationships to cook together.

### How Does It Work?

In Cook Together, users can create recipes that they want to cook with their family, friend, or loved one. Next, they can create a session and share the link to the session for other people to join (at the moment, the maximum amount of people in a session is only 2). They can then start the session and cook together, sharing the same step-by-step instructions to cook together.

The host can track the progress of the one joining their session, and vice versa.

### How Does Cook Together Use Supabase?

Cook Together uses Supabase to handle realtime changes on the UI. This application also uses Supabase Database to store users and recipes data, as well as Supabase Storage to handle recipe image uploads.
